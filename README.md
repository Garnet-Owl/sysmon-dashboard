## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

sysmon-dashboard

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Notes:

I Made this dashboard on a saturday [15th Feb 2025] after I came accross a video from YouTube of a guy,
I think he is a CyberSecurity expert or something, and he was talking about Sysmon - logging tool from Microsoft that lets you log all activity
foreground and background.

and he was examining evrerything from the event viewer and after I tried it myself I had to through a lot of nested folders
and I din't like that, so I thought, 'I'm gonna build a dashboard for this' Haha, and here I am.

If you like it, feel free to contribute. Really, I'm no expert, ... Yet! But I'll get there, and Soon, or in time, whatever.

Adios!

More importantly I have decided to be publishing repos for my small projects so that a future version of myself, and hopefully a more competent one, 
can always come here and see the progress we have made.

Future self, if you are reading this, know that you don't always get to see the bigger picture, in the present moment, but trust in and remain
committed to the plans you make.

The key is in consistency. The daily persuit of the highest sense of self you can possibly achieve, eventually pays off.
