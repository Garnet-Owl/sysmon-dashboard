Notes:

I Made this dashboard on a saturday [15th Feb 2025] after I came accross a video from YouTube of a guy,
I think he is a CyberSecurity expert or something, and he was talking about Sysmon - logging tool from Microsoft that lets you log all activity
foreground and background.

and he was examining evrerything from the event viewer and after I tried it myself I had to through a lot of nested folders
and I din't like that, so I thought, 'I'm gonna build a dashboard for this' Haha, and here I am.

If you like it, feel free to contribute. Really, I'm not expert, ... Yet! But I'll get there, and Soon, or in time, whatever.
